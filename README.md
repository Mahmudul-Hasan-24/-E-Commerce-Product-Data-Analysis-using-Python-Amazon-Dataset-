# 🛒 E-Commerce Product Data Analysis (Amazon Dataset)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on an Amazon e-commerce product dataset.  
The goal is to:
- Explore **product categories, pricing, ratings, and reviews**
- Uncover **patterns that affect sales and customer behavior**
- Provide **insights that can support pricing, marketing, and inventory decisions**

## 🔍 Analysis Steps

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Handle missing values
   - Remove duplicates
   - Convert numerical columns (e.g., price, rating) to proper format

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Distribution of product ratings
   - Price range distribution across categories
   - Relationship between discount %, price, and reviews

3. **Visualization**
   - Histograms, bar plots, and box plots to reveal patterns
   - Category-wise rating distribution
   - Correlation heatmap for numerical variables

4. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Identify top-performing categories
   - Suggest price optimization opportunities
   - Recommend focus areas for marketing campaigns

## 📊 Key Insights

| Insight | Observation |
|--------|-------------|
| ⭐ Rating Distribution | Most products have ratings between 3.5 and 4.5 |
| 💲 Pricing | Discounted products receive **20–30% more reviews** |
| 🏷 Category Insights | Electronics and Fashion dominate product count |
| 🔗 Correlation | Positive relationship between review count and rating (popular products rated higher) |
